# Project 7 - React Gallery App

* To be able to use this app, you will need to 
  set up within the **src** folder, create a folder named **config** and insed taht folder, create a file named **config.js**. In that filed you will set up variable which will hold an API Key and export it from that file. The API Key can be obtained here: **https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/**
* Once the above step is complete the app should be ready
  for use. Once open, the first page is displayed. The search bar, and the three default tabs are displayed throughout the app, with the gallery of images dynamically shown based on user action
* Different images can be displayed by clicking on one 
  of the three default tabs given, or searched manually
  in the search bar 
* If there is no valid images returned from the search, 
  a **no-results** page is rendered, or if the user types in an unknown url, a **404** page is rendered
* During the time the page is loading a different image
  gallery, the user is notified of a *loading* indicator in between galleries
* When using the broswer's back and forward buttons, 
  the page is shown with the correct url and gallery of
  it's respective images
