# Project 7 - React Gallery App

## Project Details
* To be able to use this app, you will need to 
  set up within the **src** folder, create a folder named **config** and insed taht folder, create a file named **config.js**. In that filed you will set up variable which will hold an API Key and export it from that file. The API Key can be obtained here: **https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/**
* Once the above step is complete the app should be ready
  for use. Once open, the first page is displayed. The search bar, and the three default tabs are displayed throughout the app, with the gallery of images dynamically shown based on user action
* Different images can be displayed by clicking on one 
  of the three default tabs given, or searched manually
  in the search bar 
* If there is no valid images returned from the search, 
  a **no-results** page is rendered, or if the user types in an unknown url, a **404** page is rendered
* During the time the page is loading a different image
  gallery, the user is notified of a *loading* indicator in between galleries
* When using the broswer's back and forward buttons, 
  the page is shown with the correct url and gallery of
  it's respective images  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
